Upgrade history
===============

The current version of the Bitten schema is version 12.

Version 12
----------

* `last activity` column added to `bitten_build`.

Version 11
----------

* Badly named log level files that ended with `.log.level` created by earlier
  versions of Bitten were renamed to end in `.log.levels` which is the correct
  extension.

* Log level files that had not been correctly deleted by earlier versions of
  Bitten were cleaned up.

Version 10
----------

* PostgreSQL sequences on the `id` column that had not been correctly updated
  by previous Bitten upgrade scripts were corrected. This affected four tables:
  `bitten_build`, `bitten_log`, `bitten_platform` and `bitten_report`.

* A unique index on the columns `(config, platform, rev)` was added to the
  `bitten_build` table and an old unique index on `(config, rev, slave)` was
  removed.

.. note::

  The lack of an index on `(config, platform, rev)` in ealier versions of
  Bitten allowed duplicate builds to be created in the database under some
  conditions. These duplicate builds need to be manually removed before the
  upgrade to version 10 can complete. 
   
Version 9
---------

* The `id` column of the `bitten_rule` table was converted from a text column
  to an integer one.

Version 8
---------

* Log messages that had been stored in the `bitten_log_messages` table were
  migrated to files.

* A `filename` field was added to the `bitten_log` table to record the
  location of the new log files.

Version 7
---------

* The `bitten_error` table as added to record the reasons for step failures.

Version 6
---------

* Filenames stored in the `value` column of `bitten_report_item` where
  normalized to use `/` as the path separator.

* The `generator` columns in `bitten_log` and `bitten_report` previously
  stored just the short tag name of the associated generator. These were
  updated to store the full tag name of the generator (including the XML
  namespace). For example, `pipe` was changed to
  `http://bitten.edgewall.org/tools/sh#pipe`.

Version 5
---------

* An `orderno` column was added to the `bitten_log` table to record the
  order in which sets of log messages were generated.

* The `bitten_report` and `bitten_report_item` tables were added to record
  reports generated by unit tests and other build tools.

* Report data was imported from the old Berkeley DB XML store into the new
  database tables.

Version 4
---------

* The build configuration that generated a report was added to the report
  metadata in the Berkeley DB XML store.

Version 3
---------

* The `recipe` column was added to `bitten_config` to store the recipe XML.

Version 2
---------

* The `bitten_log` and `bitten_log_message` tables were created for storing
  log messages.
   
* The `log` column was removed from `bitten_step` and the log messages where
  migrated to the two new logging tables.

Version 1
---------

* The first Bitten database schema.
